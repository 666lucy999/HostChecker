### THIS IS MY STUPID HOST CHECKER IN PYTHON ###

# Requirements:
You need to have Python3 installed on your machine
Sim card without any data to get accurate results

# Why did I create this:
I just thought it might be usefull to check if mutliple sites are working for free on my network

# How it works:
The programs check for links in the 'hosts.txt'
You can add your own hosts on the file
But for the program to work you must make sure there is only host per line

# When the program is done:
When the program is done you will see new files that contain the filtered hosts

# The files generated
In the 'Zero Rated Hosts.txt' file, it will contain all the hosts that work for free on that network.
In the 'Dummy Rated Hosts.txt' file it will contain all the hosts that might give you status 301, 302, 400.
In the 'Weird Rated Hosts.txt' file it will contain the hosts that didn't fit both the categories above, those sites don't work at all, but it might be a good idea to keep them just in case.
